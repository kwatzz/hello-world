Just another repository

I'm Trevor, and this is my first repository. A quote: "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men just how little they know about what they imagine they can design." - FA Hayek

Here's a second quote, which I pushed from my Mac: "When goods do not cross borders, soldiers will." - Frederic Bastiat
